# LCEL and Tool Calling Demo

Small experiment using LangChain.

What’s in here:
- LCEL prompt chaining
- LLM reasoning over a dataset summary
- Basic tool calling with manual execution

This is not a production system.  
Just a learning and reference repo.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
